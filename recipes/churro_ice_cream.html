        <h2 id="description" class="header">Description</h2>
        <p id="description" class="para">How do you get the cinnamon and sugar taste of those beloved Churro sticks 
        found at a state fair or amusement park without actually deep frying Churros and 
        chopping them up for a final churn? You make a Churro crumb by combining yellow cake 
        mix with a cinnamon and sugar streusel, then add it in  during the last churning stage. 
        The little bit of dry cake mix gives it all the needed flavor, too much and you will have
        cake batter flavored ice cream.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a stand mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, 
                combine and mix flour, sugar, light brown sugar, cake 
                mix and cinnamon. Add cold butter and mix on low until 
                mixture is crumbly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="ingredients" class="ice_cream header2">Making the Ice Cream:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add 1 cup of cream, milk, sugar and salt into a saucepan 
                of medium heat. Stir mixture until sugar dissolves and tiny
                 bubbles appear around the edge of the pan, about 3-4 minutes.
                  Add in cinnamon sticks and vanilla extract and stir to combine.
                   Cover the pan and let aromatics steep for 1 hour. Steep longer
                    for a stronger flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an ice bath by filling a large roasting pan or casserole dish
                 with ice water half way up. Pour remaining cup of cream into a medium
                  size bowl and place the bowl into the ice bath and place a strainer 
                  on top of the bowl. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reheat the steeping cream mixture over medium high heat until bubbles 
                form along the edge once more, about 1-2 minutes. Pour reheated mixture
                 into a new sauce pan and set aside for 3 minutes to cool. Pour reheated
                  (cooled slightly) cream mixture into the egg yolks and whisk constantly
                   to prevent curdling. Place the combined egg and reheated cream mixture
                    to a saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the 
                    custard thickens (it should be thick enough to coat the back of a 
                    spatula and hold a line drawn through it) and temperature on an 
                    instant read thermometer reads 175 degrees F. Remove pan from heat
                    and strain custard into the cold cream in the ice bath. Stir custard
                    mixture to below 70 degrees over ice bath.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer custard to refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.
                 Remove from refrigerator and transfer to your ice cream maker and churn
                  according to manufacturer's instructions. Add churro crumb during the last
                   5 minutes of churning. Transfer churned ice cream to an airtight container
                    and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight.
